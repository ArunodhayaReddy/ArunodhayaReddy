    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Since the introduction of data visualization, Dr. John Snow's use of data
      visualization to find relation between the contaminated water and cholera
      disease is a revolution. Data Visualization of cholera epidemic in London
      in 1854 is recreation of Dr. John Snow's map of London's 1854 cholera
      epidemic done by Arunodhaya Reddy Chityala for the course work of
      Visualization Design, Analysis, & Evaluation course project(H517.)
    </p>
    <h2>Data</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square">
      <li>
        'streets.json' is the json file which stores the data of coordinates
        ofthe streets as the series of line segments.
      </li>
      <li>'pumps.csv' stores the coordinates of all 13 pump locations</li>
      <li>
        'deathdays.csv' stores the data of all the number od deaths for each day
        of the outbreak
      </li>
      <li>
        'deaths_age_sex.csv' stores the data of age and sex of dead victims
        along with location of the victim.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Initial Design Idea</h2>
    <p>
      Initial design is as given below and I thought of showing number of deaths
      in each day to be represented in graphical representations and later
      changed to cumulative number of deaths per each day. Layout is also
      changed from initial idea for better visuals.
    </p>

      src="images/1.jpeg"

    <h2>Design Layout</h2>
    <img
      src="images/2.jpeg"
      alt="25"
      style="height: 500px; width: 800px"
      title="Actual Design Layout"
    />
    <br />
    <p>
      Layout has been changed from initial design by having the time series line
      chart beside the map and start date and end date is kept at top. As it
      will be easy and better visualize the changes in map as we hover over the
      data in the time series chart.
    </p>
    <img
      src="images/3.jpeg"
      alt="25"
      style="height: 360px; width: 800px"
      title="date, show on map, cumulative deaths"
    />
    <br />
    <p>
      As mentioned in the initial design idea, visualizations are changed from
      displaying number of deaths on each day to the cumulative number of deaths
      till that date. To have better understanding in the pattern of deaths for
      the user I have added an option for user input which has starting date and
      ending date. If user wants to get data of deaths of nth day user has to
      mention n-1 day in starting date and n in the ending date.
    </p>
    <img
      src="images/4.jpeg"
      alt="25"
      style="height: 300px; width: 500px"
      title="Time series Line Chart showing cumulative deaths"
    />
    <br />
    <p>
      Map will display the details of pumps, warehouse, brewery and deaths with
      locations. Time series chart is created for cumulative number of deaths
      for each day from 19 Aug to 29 Sept. Stacked bar graph will represent the
      gender of the victims and x-axis shows the age of victims. An information
      block will show which shape and colour represents which item in the map.
    </p>
    <img
      src="images/5.jpeg"
      alt="25"
      style="height: 600px; width: 400px"
      title="Map showing details of pumps, brewery, work house and deaths."
    />
    <br />
    <p>
      Deaths in map and bar graph changes as we hover over the time series chart
      as a part of interactive visualizations. When we hover on the deaths on
      Map it will give details of gender and age of that particular victim. We
      can also zoom in/out and pan in the map.
    </p>
    <h2>Design Choices</h2>
    <p>
      In Map, I have used Red, Green and Yellow colours for pump, brewery and
      work house respectively. To help them differentiate the red and Green
      colour for color blindness I have used different shapes for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      For time series data I have used the line chart as it is simplest and
      better for understanding. For gender and age I have used stacked bar graph
      where gender will be shown in different colour in each bar and different
      bars for different age groups.
    </p>
    <img
      src="images/6.jpeg"
      alt="25"
      style="height: 300px; width: 450px"
      title="Bar chart showing gender and age data."
    />
    <p>
      I have used d3.schemecategory10 for colours of ages. Then I have checked
      for colour blindness by colour oracle.
    </p>
    <h2>Research Questions</h2>
    <p>
      1. Is there any difference in immunity for cholera between children,
      adults and old age people?
    </p>
    <p>2. Are Men More prone to cholera than Women?</p>
    <p>
      Both the research questions can be answered from bar chart for entire
      days.
    </p>
    <img
      src="images/7.jpeg"
      alt="25"
      style="height: 300px; width: 450px"
      title="Research Question 1."
    />
    <p>
      Here we can see number of deaths of children and old age people is high
      which answers the first research question that children and old people
      have less immunity for cholera. There is no significant difference between
      deaths of men and women which says that men are not more prone to cholera
      than men.
    </p>
    <h4>Other Insights That Can be Uncovered</h4>
    <p>
      I wonder if there are any other factors that effect the deaths by cholera
      like:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square">
      <li>
        Is cholera virus ppm in water reduces as the distance from source of
        water increases?
      </li>
      <li>
        Why is there sudden rise of deaths from 30 Aug to 2nd Sept and decline
        from there?
      </li>
    </ul>
